# 2048-engine

A toy project where I explore the game of 2048.
The first few steps are coding the game logic and ensuring accurate score counting.
So far, we can make moves and add up our scores.

In the near future, simple greedy heuristic based decision 
making system will be added to decide the optimal move at a particular board state.


The tutorial for the game can be found here.
